O60885	BRD4_HUMAN	reviewed	Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Protein HUNK1)	BRD4 HUNK1	Homo sapiens (Human)	1362	FUNCTION: Chromatin reader protein that recognizes and binds acetylated histones and plays a key role in transmission of epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Remains associated with acetylated chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and provides epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving acetylated chromatin status and maintaining high-order chromatin structure (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:23317504, PubMed:22334664). During interphase, plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by associating with the P-TEFb complex and recruiting it to promoters. Also recruits P-TEFb complex to distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers in collaboration with JMJD6. BRD4 and JMJD6 are required to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb complex by displacing negative regulators such as HEXIM1 and 7SKsnRNA complex from P-TEFb, thereby transforming it into an active form that can then phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:19596240, PubMed:16109377, PubMed:16109376, PubMed:24360279). Promotes phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23086925). According to a report, directly acts as an atypical protein kinase and mediates phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; these data however need additional evidences in vivo (PubMed:22509028). In addition to acetylated histones, also recognizes and binds acetylated RELA, leading to further recruitment of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19103749). Also acts as a regulator of p53/TP53-mediated transcription: following phosphorylation by CK2, recruited to p53/TP53 specific target promoters (PubMed:23317504). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19596240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22334664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22509028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23317504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24360279}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform B]: Acts as a chromatin insulator in the DNA damage response pathway. Inhibits DNA damage response signaling by recruiting the condensin-2 complex to acetylated histones, leading to chromatin structure remodeling, insulating the region from DNA damage response by limiting spreading of histone H2AX/H2A.x phosphorylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23728299}.
Q9UER7	DAXX_HUMAN	reviewed	Death domain-associated protein 6 (Daxx) (hDaxx) (ETS1-associated protein 1) (EAP1) (Fas death domain-associated protein)	DAXX BING2 DAP6	Homo sapiens (Human)	740	FUNCTION: Transcription corepressor known to repress transcriptional potential of several sumoylated transcription factors. Down-regulates basal and activated transcription. Its transcription repressor activity is modulated by recruiting it to subnuclear compartments like the nucleolus or PML/POD/ND10 nuclear bodies through interactions with MCSR1 and PML, respectively. Seems to regulate transcription in PML/POD/ND10 nuclear bodies together with PML and may influence TNFRSF6-dependent apoptosis thereby. Inhibits transcriptional activation of PAX3 and ETS1 through direct protein-protein interactions. Modulates PAX5 activity; the function seems to involve CREBBP. Acts as an adapter protein in a MDM2-DAXX-USP7 complex by regulating the RING-finger E3 ligase MDM2 ubiquitination activity. Under non-stress condition, in association with the deubiquitinating USP7, prevents MDM2 self-ubiquitination and enhances the intrinsic E3 ligase activity of MDM2 towards TP53, thereby promoting TP53 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Upon DNA damage, its association with MDM2 and USP7 is disrupted, resulting in increased MDM2 autoubiquitination and consequently, MDM2 degradation, which leads to TP53 stabilization. Acts as histone chaperone that facilitates deposition of histone H3.3. Acts as targeting component of the chromatin remodeling complex ATRX:DAXX which has ATP-dependent DNA translocase activity and catalyzes the replication-independent deposition of histone H3.3 in pericentric DNA repeats outside S-phase and telomeres, and the in vitro remodeling of H3.3-containing nucleosomes. Does not affect the ATPase activity of ATRX but alleviates its transcription repression activity. Upon neuronal activation associates with regulatory elements of selected immediate early genes where it promotes deposition of histone H3.3 which may be linked to transcriptional induction of these genes. Required for the recruitment of histone H3.3:H4 dimers to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs); the process is independent of ATRX and facilitated by ASF1A; PML-NBs are suggested to function as regulatory sites for the incorporation of newly synthesized histone H3.3 into chromatin. In case of overexpression of centromeric histone variant CENPA (as found in various tumors) is involved in its mislocalization to chromosomes; the ectopic localization involves a heterotypic tetramer containing CENPA, and histones H3.3 and H4 and decreases binding of CTCF to chromatin. Proposed to mediate activation of the JNK pathway and apoptosis via MAP3K5 in response to signaling from TNFRSF6 and TGFBR2. Interaction with HSPB1/HSP27 may prevent interaction with TNFRSF6 and MAP3K5 and block DAXX-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, in lymphoid cells JNC activation and TNFRSF6-mediated apoptosis may not involve DAXX. Shows restriction activity towards human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Plays a role as a positive regulator of the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 activity during the stress protein response (PubMed:15016915). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12140263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14990586, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15364927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845383, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17942542, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20651253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23222847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24200965, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24530302}.

After initial cleavage, continues to digest histones tails via its aminopeptidase activity (PubMed:28847961, PubMed:29459673). Upon DNA damage, cleaves the N-terminal tail of histone H3 at monomethylated lysine residues, preferably at monomethylated 'Lys-9' (H3K9me1). The histone variant H3F3A is the major target for cleavage (PubMed:28982940). Additionnally, acts as Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent monoxygenase, catalyzing (R)-stereospecific hydroxylation at C-3 of 'Arg-137' of RPS6 and 'Arg-141' of RCCD1, but the biological significance of this activity remains to be established (PubMed:29563586). Regulates mitosis through different mechanisms: Plays a role in transcriptional repression of satellite repeats, possibly by regulating H3K36 methylation levels in centromeric regions together with RCCD1. Possibly together with RCCD1, is involved in proper mitotic spindle organization and chromosome segregation (PubMed:24981860).

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.

Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). Also controls the recruitment of UIMC1-BRCC3 (RAP80-BRCC36) and PAXIP1/PTIP to DNA damage sites. Also recruited at DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) sites and catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, leading to recruitment of FAAP20/C1orf86 and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, followed by interstrand cross-link repair. H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Promotes the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interactions with the specific ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2N/UBC13 and ubiquitinates non-histone substrates such as PCNA. Substrates that are polyubiquitinated at 'Lys-63' are usually not targeted for degradation. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2L6/UBCH8, leading to degradation of substrate proteins such as CHEK2, JMJD2A/KDM4A and KU80/XRCC5: it is still unclear how the preference toward 'Lys-48'- versus 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination is regulated but it could be due to RNF8 ability to interact with specific E2 specific ligases. For instance, interaction with phosphorylated HERC2 promotes the association between RNF8 and UBE2N/UBC13 and favors the specific formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. Promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination and degradation the of KU80/XRCC5. Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of JMJD2A/KDM4A in collaboration with RNF168, leading to unmask H4K20me2 mark and promote the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites (PubMed:11322894, PubMed:14981089, PubMed:17724460, PubMed:18001824, PubMed:18001825, PubMed:18006705, PubMed:18077395, PubMed:18337245, PubMed:18948756, PubMed:19015238, PubMed:19124460, PubMed:19202061, PubMed:19203578, PubMed:19203579, PubMed:20550933, PubMed:21558560, PubMed:21857671, PubMed:21911360, PubMed:22266820, PubMed:22373579, PubMed:22531782, PubMed:22705371, PubMed:22865450, PubMed:22980979). Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of POLD4/p12, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In the absence of POLD4, DNA polymerase delta complex exhibits higher proofreading activity (PubMed:23233665). In addition to its function in damage signaling, also plays a role in higher-order chromatin structure by mediating extensive chromatin decondensation. Involved in the activation of ATM by promoting histone H2B ubiquitination, which indirectly triggers histone H4 'Lys-16' acetylation (H4K16ac), establishing a chromatin environment that promotes efficient activation of ATM kinase. Required in the testis, where it plays a role in the replacement of histones during spermatogenesis. At uncapped telomeres, promotes the joining of deprotected chromosome ends by inducing H2A ubiquitination and TP53BP1 recruitment, suggesting that it may enhance cancer development by aggravating telomere-induced genome instability in case of telomeric crisis. Promotes the assembly of RAD51 at DNA DSBs in the absence of BRCA1 and TP53BP1 Also involved in class switch recombination in immune system, via its role in regulation of DSBs repair.

The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus (PubMed:18485871, PubMed:21504832).

Upon oxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2 (PubMed:18004385, PubMed:21504832).

This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair (PubMed:14966270). The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400.

In association with DTX3L and in presence of E1 and E2 enzymes, mediates NAD(+)-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin which prevents ubiquitin conjugation to substrates such as histones (PubMed:28525742). During DNA repair, PARP1 recruits PARP9/BAL1-DTX3L complex to DNA damage sites via PARP9 binding to ribosylated PARP1 (PubMed:23230272). Subsequent PARP1-dependent PARP9/BAL1-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272, PubMed:28525742).

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19754430}.

Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Participates also in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities. Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at 'Ser-10' that are subsequently acetylated at 'Lys-14' by CREBBP.

Restricts the expression of neuronal genes by associating with two distinct corepressors, SIN3A and RCOR1, which in turn recruit histone deacetylase to the promoters of REST-regulated genes (PubMed:10449787, PubMed:10734093). Mediates repression by recruiting the BHC complex at RE1/NRSE sites which acts by deacetylating and demethylating specific sites on histones, thereby acting as a chromatin modifier (By similarity). Transcriptional repression by REST-CDYL via the recruitment of histone methyltransferase EHMT2 may be important in transformation suppression (PubMed:19061646). Represses the expression of SRRM4 in non-neural cells to prevent the activation of neural-specific splicing events and to prevent production of REST isoform 3 (By similarity). Repressor activity may be inhibited by forming heterodimers with isoform 3, thereby preventing binding to NRSE or binding to corepressors and leading to derepression of target genes (PubMed:11779185). Also maintains repression of neuronal genes in neural stem cells, and allows transcription and differentiation into neurons by dissociation from RE1/NRSE sites of target genes (By similarity). Thereby is involved in maintaining the quiescent state of adult neural stem cells and preventing premature differentiation into mature neurons (PubMed:21258371).

O43463	SUV91_HUMAN	reviewed	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUV39H1 (EC 2.1.1.355) (Histone H3-K9 methyltransferase 1) (H3-K9-HMTase 1) (Lysine N-methyltransferase 1A) (Position-effect variegation 3-9 homolog) (Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1) (Su(var)3-9 homolog 1)	SUV39H1 KMT1A SUV39H	Homo sapiens (Human)	412	FUNCTION: Histone methyltransferase that specifically trimethylates 'Lys-9' of histone H3 using monomethylated H3 'Lys-9' as substrate. Also weakly methylates histone H1 (in vitro). H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting HP1 (CBX1, CBX3 and/or CBX5) proteins to methylated histones. Mainly functions in heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric and telomere regions. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is also required to direct DNA methylation at pericentric repeats. SUV39H1 is targeted to histone H3 via its interaction with RB1 and is involved in many processes, such as repression of MYOD1-stimulated differentiation, regulation of the control switch for exiting the cell cycle and entering differentiation, repression by the PML-RARA fusion protein, BMP-induced repression, repression of switch recombination to IgA and regulation of telomere length. Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Recruited by the large PER complex to the E-box elements of the circadian target genes such as PER2 itself or PER1, contributes to the conversion of local chromatin to a heterochromatin-like repressive state through H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14765126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16449642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16818776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18004385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18485871}.
Q12824	SNF5_HUMAN	reviewed	SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 (BRG1-associated factor 47) (BAF47) (Integrase interactor 1 protein) (SNF5 homolog) (hSNF5)	SMARCB1 BAF47 INI1 SNF5L1	Homo sapiens (Human)	385	FUNCTION: Core component of the BAF (hSWI/SNF) complex. This ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex plays important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, in cellular antiviral activities and inhibition of tumor formation. The BAF complex is able to create a stable, altered form of chromatin that constrains fewer negative supercoils than normal. This change in supercoiling would be due to the conversion of up to one-half of the nucleosomes on polynucleosomal arrays into asymmetric structures, termed altosomes, each composed of 2 histones octamers. Stimulates in vitro the remodeling activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A. Involved in activation of CSF1 promoter. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Plays a key role in cell-cycle control and causes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0H3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12226744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9448295}.

Plays a key role in HBO1 complex by directing KAT7/HBO1 specificity towards histone H4 acetylation (H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac), regulating DNA replication initiation, regulating DNA replication initiation (PubMed:20129055, PubMed:24065767). May also promote acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 by KAT5 (PubMed:15502158). Promotes apoptosis (PubMed:16046545). May act as a renal tumor suppressor (PubMed:16046545).

The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II. The FACT complex is probably also involved in phosphorylation of 'Ser-392' of p53/TP53 via its association with CK2 (casein kinase II). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10912001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11239457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12934006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16713563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9489704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9836642}.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. Binds via DLX1 to enhancers located in the intergenic region between DLX5 and DLX6 and this binding is stabilized by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Evf2 (By similarity).

According to another report, PHF1 recruits the PRC2 complex at double-strand breaks (DSBs) and inhibits the activity of PRC2 (PubMed:23142980). Regulates p53/TP53 stability and prolonges its turnover: may act by specifically binding to a methylated from of p53/TP53. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18086877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18285464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18385154, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23142980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23150668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23273982}.
Q5QNW6	H2B2F_HUMAN	reviewed	Histone H2B type 2-F (H2B-clustered histone 18)	H2BC18 HIST2H2BF	Homo sapiens (Human)	126	FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.

It is involved in neuroprotective mechanisms like the stabilization of NFE2L2 and PINK1 proteins, male fertility as a positive regulator of androgen signaling pathway as well as cell growth and transformation through, for instance, the modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway (PubMed:12612053, PubMed:15502874, PubMed:14749723, PubMed:17015834, PubMed:21097510, PubMed:18711745). Has been described as a protein and nucleotide deglycase that catalyzes the deglycation of the Maillard adducts formed between amino groups of proteins or nucleotides and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:28596309). But this function is rebuted by other works (PubMed:27903648, PubMed:31653696). As a protein deglycase, repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:28013050, PubMed:26995087). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair (PubMed:28596309). Protects histones from adduction by methylglyoxal, controls the levels of methylglyoxal-derived argininine modifications on chromatin (PubMed:30150385). Able to remove the glycations and restore histone 3, histone glycation disrupts both local and global chromatin architecture by altering histone-DNA interactions as well as histone acetylation and ubiquitination levels (PubMed:30150385, PubMed:30894531).

Enzymatically inactive by itself, and becomes active following phosphorylation by PKA: forms a complex with ARID5B and mediates demethylation of methylated ARID5B. Demethylation of ARID5B leads to target the PHF2-ARID5B complex to target promoters, where PHF2 mediates demethylation of dimethylated 'Lys-9' of histone H3 (H3K9me2), followed by transcription activation of target genes. The PHF2-ARID5B complex acts as a coactivator of HNF4A in liver. PHF2 is recruited to trimethylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me3) at rDNA promoters and promotes expression of rDNA. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20129925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21167174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21532585}.

The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II. The FACT complex is probably also involved in phosphorylation of 'Ser-392' of p53/TP53 via its association with CK2 (casein kinase II). Binds specifically to double-stranded DNA and at low levels to DNA modified by the antitumor agent cisplatin.

Q01831	XPC_HUMAN	reviewed	DNA repair protein complementing XP-C cells (Xeroderma pigmentosum group C-complementing protein) (p125)	XPC XPCC	Homo sapiens (Human)	940	FUNCTION: Involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) by acting as damage sensing and DNA-binding factor component of the XPC complex (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465, PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). Has only a low DNA repair activity by itself which is stimulated by RAD23B and RAD23A. Has a preference to bind DNA containing a short single-stranded segment but not to damaged oligonucleotides (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465). This feature is proposed to be related to a dynamic sensor function: XPC can rapidly screen duplex DNA for non-hydrogen-bonded bases by forming a transient nucleoprotein intermediate complex which matures into a stable recognition complex through an intrinsic single-stranded DNA-binding activity (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465). The XPC complex is proposed to represent the first factor bound at the sites of DNA damage and together with other core recognition factors, XPA, RPA and the TFIIH complex, is part of the pre-incision (or initial recognition) complex (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). The XPC complex recognizes a wide spectrum of damaged DNA characterized by distortions of the DNA helix such as single-stranded loops, mismatched bubbles or single-stranded overhangs (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). The orientation of XPC complex binding appears to be crucial for inducing a productive NER (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). XPC complex is proposed to recognize and to interact with unpaired bases on the undamaged DNA strand which is followed by recruitment of the TFIIH complex and subsequent scanning for lesions in the opposite strand in a 5'-to-3' direction by the NER machinery (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) which are formed upon UV-induced DNA damage esacpe detection by the XPC complex due to a low degree of structural perurbation. Instead they are detected by the UV-DDB complex which in turn recruits and cooperates with the XPC complex in the respective DNA repair (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). In vitro, the XPC:RAD23B dimer is sufficient to initiate NER; it preferentially binds to cisplatin and UV-damaged double-stranded DNA and also binds to a variety of chemically and structurally diverse DNA adducts (PubMed:20028083). XPC:RAD23B contacts DNA both 5' and 3' of a cisplatin lesion with a preference for the 5' side. XPC:RAD23B induces a bend in DNA upon binding. XPC:RAD23B stimulates the activity of DNA glycosylases TDG and SMUG1 (PubMed:20028083). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10734143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10873465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12547395, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19609301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19941824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20028083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20649465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20798892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9734359}.; FUNCTION: In absence of DNA repair, the XPC complex also acts as a transcription coactivator: XPC interacts with the DNA-binding transcription factor E2F1 at a subset of promoters to recruit KAT2A and histone acetyltransferase complexes (HAT) (PubMed:29973595, PubMed:31527837). KAT2A recruitment specifically promotes acetylation of histone variant H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z, but not H2A.Z.2/H2A.V, thereby promoting expression of target genes (PubMed:31527837). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29973595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31527837}.

Binds dinucleosomes, probably at the linker region between neighboring nucleosomes. Plays a role in chromatin remodeling. May promote TP53/p53 'Lys-321' acetylation, leading to reduced TP53 stability and transcriptional activity (PubMed:22644376).

The BRCA1-A complex also possesses deubiquitinase activity that specifically removes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on histones H2A and H2AX. Also weakly binds monoubiquitin but with much less affinity than 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin. May interact with monoubiquitinated histones H2A and H2B; the relevance of such results is however unclear in vivo. Does not bind Lys-48'-linked ubiquitin.

Acts as a transcription activator as H3K9Me1, H3K9Me2, H3K27Me2 and H4K20Me1 are epigenetic repressive marks. Involved in cell cycle progression by being required to control G1-S transition. Acts as a coactivator of rDNA transcription, by activating polymerase I (pol I) mediated transcription of rRNA genes. Required for brain development, probably by regulating expression of neuron-specific genes.

Some complexes also catalyze acetylation of histone H4 at 'Lys-5', 'Lys-8' and 'Lys-12' (H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac, respectively), regulating DNA replication initiation, regulating DNA replication initiation (PubMed:10438470, PubMed:19187766, PubMed:20129055, PubMed:24065767). Specificity of the HBO1 complexes is determined by the scaffold subunit: complexes containing BRPF scaffold (BRPF1, BRD1/BRPF2 or BRPF3) direct KAT7/HBO1 specificity towards H3K14ac, while complexes containing JADE (JADE1, JADE2 and JADE3) scaffold direct KAT7/HBO1 specificity towards histone H4 (PubMed:19187766, PubMed:20129055, PubMed:24065767, PubMed:26620551). H3K14ac promotes transcriptional elongation by facilitating the processivity of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:31827282). Acts as a key regulator of hematopoiesis by forming a complex with BRD1/BRPF2, directing KAT7/HBO1 specificity towards H3K14ac and promoting erythroid differentiation (PubMed:21753189). H3K14ac is also required for T-cell development (By similarity). KAT7/HBO1-mediated acetylation facilitates two consecutive steps, licensing and activation, in DNA replication initiation: H3K14ac facilitates the activation of replication origins, and histone H4 acetylation (H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac) facilitates chromatin loading of MCM complexes, promoting DNA replication licensing (PubMed:10438470, PubMed:11278932, PubMed:18832067, PubMed:19187766, PubMed:20129055, PubMed:21856198, PubMed:24065767, PubMed:26620551). Acts as a positive regulator of centromeric CENPA assembly: recruited to centromeres and mediates histone acetylation, thereby preventing centromere inactivation mediated by SUV39H1, possibly by increasing histone turnover/exchange (PubMed:27270040). Involved in nucleotide excision repair: phosphorylation by ATR in response to ultraviolet irradiation promotes its localization to DNA damage sites, where it mediates histone acetylation to facilitate recruitment of XPC at the damaged DNA sites (PubMed:28719581). Acts as an inhibitor of NF-kappa-B independently of its histone acetyltransferase activity (PubMed:16997280). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5SVQ0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10438470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16387653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16997280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18832067, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19187766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20129055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21753189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21856198, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24065767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26620551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27270040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28719581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31767635, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827282}.; FUNCTION: Plays a central role in the maintenance of leukemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PubMed:31827282).

O15516	CLOCK_HUMAN	reviewed	Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) (EC 2.3.1.48) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHe8)	CLOCK BHLHE8 KIAA0334	Homo sapiens (Human)	846	FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The CLOCK-ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking Ala residue in addition to the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while ARNTL binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner ARNTL/BMAL1. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region (PubMed:21980503). The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as important as its transcription activity in circadian control. Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner. Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and subsequent ureagenesis (PubMed:28985504). Drives the circadian rhythm of blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21980503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22284746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28985504}.

As a scaffold protein may contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the complex is dependent on the neddylation of the cullin subunit and is inhibited by the association of the deneddylated cullin subunit with TIP120A/CAND1. The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex depends on the variable substrate recognition component. DCX(DET1-COP1) directs ubiquitination of JUN. DCX(DDB2) directs ubiquitination of XPC. DCX(DDB2) ubiquitinates histones H3-H4 and is required for efficient histone deposition during replication-coupled (H3.1) and replication-independent (H3.3) nucleosome assembly, probably by facilitating the transfer of H3 from ASF1A/ASF1B to other chaperones involved in histone deposition. DCX(DTL) plays a role in PCNA-dependent polyubiquitination of CDT1 and MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of TP53 in response to radiation-induced DNA damage and during DNA replication. In association with DDB1 and SKP2 probably is involved in ubiquitination of CDKN1B/p27kip. Is involved in ubiquitination of HOXA9. DCX(DTL) directs autoubiquitination of DTL. The DDB1-CUL4A-DTL E3 ligase complex regulates the circadian clock function by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of CRY1 (PubMed:26431207).

Acting autonomously, serves itself as NLS receptor. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Mediates autonomously the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins RPL23A, RPS7 and RPL5. Binds to a beta-like import receptor binding (BIB) domain of RPL23A. In association with IPO7 mediates the nuclear import of H1 histone. In vitro, mediates nuclear import of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. In case of HIV-1 infection, binds and mediates the nuclear import of HIV-1 Rev. Imports SNAI1 and PRKCI into the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10228156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11891849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19386897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24699649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687515}.

DCX(DDB2) (also known as DDB1-CUL4-ROC1, CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1) may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage (PubMed:16678110, PubMed:17041588, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899). The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair (PubMed:16678110, PubMed:17041588, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899).

Undergoes a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:16478993, PubMed:19696785). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:27295069, PubMed:26991466). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. They first alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397).

Recognizes and binds histone H3 crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9cr), and with slightly lower affinity histone H3 crotonylated at 'Lys-18' (H3K18cr) (PubMed:27105114). Also recognizes and binds histone H3 acetylated and butyrylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac and H3K9bu, respectively), but with lower affinity than crotonylated histone H3 (PubMed:25417107, PubMed:27105114, PubMed:30385749). In the SEC complex, MLLT3 is required to recruit the complex to crotonylated histones (PubMed:27105114, PubMed:27545619). Recruitment of the SEC complex to crotonylated histones promotes recruitment of DOT1L on active chromatin to deposit histone H3 'Lys-79' methylation (H3K79me) (PubMed:25417107). Plays a key role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance by preserving, rather than confering, HSC stemness (PubMed:31776511). Acts by binding to the transcription start site of active genes in HSCs and sustaining level of H3K79me2, probably by recruiting DOT1L (PubMed:31776511). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20159561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25417107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27105114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27545619, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30374167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30385749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31776511}.

The condensin complex probably introduces positive supercoils into relaxed DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases and converts nicked DNA into positive knotted forms in the presence of type II topoisomerases. May target the condensin complex to DNA via its C-terminal domain (PubMed:11136719). May promote the resolution of double-strand DNA catenanes (intertwines) between sister chromatids. Condensin-mediated compaction likely increases tension in catenated sister chromatids, providing directionality for type II topoisomerase-mediated strand exchanges toward chromatid decatenation. Required for decatenation of non-centromeric ultrafine DNA bridges during anaphase. Early in neurogenesis, may play an essential role to ensure accurate mitotic chromosome condensation in neuron stem cells, ultimately affecting neuron pool and cortex size (PubMed:27737959). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11136719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27737959}.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Binds DNA non-specifically. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2BH40, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12672490, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability (PubMed:15257289, PubMed:16287874, PubMed:16957777, PubMed:17591702, PubMed:17726088, PubMed:18329190, PubMed:22795134). Nucleosomes containing this histone are less rigid and organize less DNA than canonical nucleosomes in vivo (PubMed:15257289, PubMed:16957777, PubMed:17591702, PubMed:24336483). They are enriched in actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of RNA polymerase (PubMed:17591702, PubMed:24753410).

Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes.

Also required for DNA methylation, the histone methyltransferase activity is not required for DNA methylation, suggesting that these 2 activities function independently. Probably targeted to histone H3 by different DNA-binding proteins like E2F6, MGA, MAX and/or DP1. During G0 phase, it probably contributes to silencing of MYC- and E2F-responsive genes, suggesting a role in G0/G1 transition in cell cycle.

Is thought to mediate docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through binding to nucleoporin and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to the importin, the importin/substrate complex dissociates and importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus (By similarity). Mediates the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins RPL23A, RPS7 and RPL5. Binds to a beta-like import receptor binding (BIB) domain of RPL23A. In vitro, mediates nuclear import of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. Binds to CPEB3 and mediates its nuclear import following neuronal stimulation (By similarity).

In the nucleus, contributes to global transcription and the DNA damage response, in addition to specific transcriptional activities that are related to cell development, proliferation and death. In the cytoplasm, interacts with and perturbs HK1- and VDAC1-containing complexes at the mitochondrial outer membrane, thereby impairing mitochondrial membrane potential, inducing mitochondrial leakage and promoting cell death. The phosphorylated form (mediated by ATM) plays a role in the DNA damage response and is involved in the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced S phase checkpoint control and in the recruitment of the MRN complex into the IR-induced foci (IRIF). Exhibits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity which specifically acetylates histones H2B and H4 in vitro (PubMed:10821277). In concert with CUL3 and RBX1, promotes the degradation of KAT5 thereby attenuating its ability to acetylate and activate ATM. Can elicit oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities depending on the tissue or cell type. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10821277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18397884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22304920}.

Monoubiquitinates several histones, including histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (PubMed:28525742). In response to DNA damage, mediates monoubiquitination of 'Lys-91' of histone H4 (H4K91ub1) (PubMed:19818714). The exact role of H4K91ub1 in DNA damage response is still unclear but it may function as a licensing signal for additional histone H4 post-translational modifications such as H4 'Lys-20' methylation (H4K20me) (PubMed:19818714). PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). By monoubiquitinating histone H2B H2BC9/H2BJ and thereby promoting chromatin remodeling, positively regulates STAT1-dependent interferon-stimulated gene transcription and thus STAT1-mediated control of viral replication (PubMed:26479788). Independently of its catalytic activity, promotes the sorting of chemokine receptor CXCR4 from early endosome to lysosome following CXCL12 stimulation by reducing E3 ligase ITCH activity and thus ITCH-mediated ubiquitination of endosomal sorting complex required for transport ESCRT-0 components HGS and STAM (PubMed:24790097).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF).

Catalytic subunit of the PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex, which methylates 'Lys-9' (H3K9me) and 'Lys-27' (H3K27me) of histone H3, leading to transcriptional repression of the affected target gene. Able to mono-, di- and trimethylate 'Lys-27' of histone H3 to form H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, respectively. Displays a preference for substrates with less methylation, loses activity when progressively more methyl groups are incorporated into H3K27, H3K27me0 > H3K27me1 > H3K27me2 (PubMed:22323599, PubMed:30923826). Compared to EZH1-containing complexes, it is more abundant in embryonic stem cells and plays a major role in forming H3K27me3, which is required for embryonic stem cell identity and proper differentiation. The PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex may also serve as a recruiting platform for DNA methyltransferases, thereby linking two epigenetic repression systems. Genes repressed by the PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex include HOXC8, HOXA9, MYT1, CDKN2A and retinoic acid target genes. EZH2 can also methylate non-histone proteins such as the transcription factor GATA4 and the nuclear receptor RORA. Regulates the circadian clock via histone methylation at the promoter of the circadian genes. Essential for the CRY1/2-mediated repression of the transcriptional activation of PER1/2 by the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer; involved in the di and trimethylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 on PER1/2 promoters which is necessary for the CRY1/2 proteins to inhibit transcription. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14532106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15225548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15231737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16179254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16357870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16618801, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16717091, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17344414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18285464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19026781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20935635, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22323599, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23063525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24474760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30923826}.

Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20819935, ECO:0000305}.

Acts as a lysyl-hydroxylase that catalyzes 5-hydroxylation on specific lysine residues of target proteins such as U2AF2/U2AF65 and LUC7L2. Regulates RNA splicing by mediating 5-hydroxylation of U2AF2/U2AF65, affecting the pre-mRNA splicing activity of U2AF2/U2AF65 (PubMed:19574390). Hydroxylates its own N-terminus, which is required for homooligomerization (PubMed:22189873). In addition to peptidyl-lysine 5-dioxygenase activity, may act as an RNA hydroxylase, as suggested by its ability to bind single strand RNA (PubMed:20679243, PubMed:29176719). Also acts as an arginine demethylase which preferentially demethylates asymmetric dimethylation (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24498420, PubMed:24360279). Demethylates histone H3 at 'Arg-2' (H3R2me) and histone H4 at 'Arg-3' (H4R3me), including mono-, symmetric di- and asymmetric dimethylated forms, thereby playing a role in histone code (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24360279). However, histone arginine demethylation may not constitute the primary activity in vivo (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:21060799, PubMed:22189873). In collaboration with BRD4, interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex in its active form to regulate polymerase II promoter-proximal pause release for transcriptional activation of a large cohort of genes. On distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers, demethylates both histone H4R3me2 and the methyl cap of 7SKsnRNA leading to the dismissal of the 7SKsnRNA:HEXIM1 inhibitor complex. After removal of repressive marks, the complex BRD4:JMJD6 attract and retain the P-TEFb complex on chromatin, leading to its activation, promoter-proximal polymerase II pause release, and transcriptional activation (PubMed:24360279). Demethylates other arginine methylated-proteins such as ESR1 (PubMed:24498420). Has no histone lysine demethylase activity (PubMed:21060799). Required for differentiation of multiple organs during embryogenesis.

Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity which is essential for its chaperone activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:11274138, PubMed:15577939, PubMed:15937123, PubMed:27353360, PubMed:29127155, PubMed:12526792). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself (PubMed:29127155). Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:27295069, PubMed:26991466). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels (PubMed:25973397). In the first place, they alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues(PubMed:25973397). Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment (PubMed:25973397). Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:11276205). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385).
